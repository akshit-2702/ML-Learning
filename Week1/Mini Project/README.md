# Day 7: Iris Dataset Mini Project ðŸŒ¸

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous **Iris flower dataset** to understand feature relationships and class separability.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- 150 samples, 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)  
- 4 features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width  

## Methods
- Data loading and inspection using **Pandas**
- Visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
  - Pairplot (feature relationships)
  - Scatter plot (Sepal length vs Petal length)
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Boxplots (species-wise distributions)

## Results
- Clear class separability between *Setosa* and the other two species.
- Petal features show stronger separation than sepal features.
- Positive correlations observed between petal length and petal width.

## Skills Practiced
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization with Seaborn  
- Interpreting feature relationships in classification problems
